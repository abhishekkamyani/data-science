## Data Scientist’s Work
A data scientist’s job involves the following tasks:

1. Data Collection: Gathering data from databases, APIs, or web scraping.
2. Data Cleaning: Removing errors, handling missing values, and preparing data for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and summarizing data to identify patterns.
4. Model Building: Using machine learning algorithms to create predictive models.
5. Model Evaluation: Testing the model’s accuracy and improving it.
6. Deployment: Implementing the model into real-world applications.
7. Communication: Presenting insights to stakeholders using visualizations and reports.

A structured approach follows these steps: Collect → Clean → Analyze → Model → Evaluate → Deploy → Communicate.
